# Asha-Connect
## A Beacon of Hope in a Refugee Crisis
Asha Connect is a web platform designed to reconnect missing Rohingya family members who have been separated due to displacement in Bangladesh. It serves as a vital tool for humanitarian aid workers and the community, offering a secure, centralized registry to document missing persons and facilitate family reunification.

The platform goes beyond a simple database. It features an offline-first PWA for seamless data entry in low-connectivity areas and a real-time chat system to enable direct communication between those searching and those with information. Through structured data collection and an intelligent matching engine, Asha Connect not only helps find missing loved ones but also provides a systematic and secure way to manage the incredibly complex process of family reunification. It's a project built on the principle of humanity, leveraging technology to bring families back together.
